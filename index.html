<h3>My Intrest</h3>
<P> Life without intrest is like food without the salt.It is a interest which makes living interesting.It is a pursuit outside one's regular work.There are many hubbies like painting, drowing, gardening, stamp collecting,reading, photography,cooking,pet care etc.My favorities hubbies are gardening, travelling, and reading, watching movie. Moving on to favourite movies; Titanic, Romeo & Juliet, Crash, Twilight. Basically the list can go on and on. I must be up to date with the latest movies.Cooking has been a huge interest of mine. My mom's a great cook- especially in Nepali cooking. I think I have got it from her. From my point of view, having learned how to cook, makes a persons life much easier.</P>
